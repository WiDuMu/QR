# QR Generator
A client-side QR code generator in Javascript. Made out of spite. I will not elaborate at this time.

This project was built using the [qrcodegen library built by Project Nayuki](https://www.nayuki.io/page/qr-code-generator-library). A very massive thank you to them and their documentation. I have modified their TypeScript 1.8.0 version to use the es6 module system better.
